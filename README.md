# iQuHack 2025 IonQ solution by Quantum Jackets

This repo contains the solution to the IonQ challenges for remote iQuHack 2025 hackathon hosted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The solutions are developed by my team called Quantum Jackets.

Notebook 1 is the solution to Challenge 1: 
Your task is to split each graph into two sets of nodes in a way that maximizes the number of edges spanning across the two sets.

Notebook 2 is the solution to Challenge 2:
Your task is almost identical to the first one, but with an added twist: you need to divide the graph in a way that ensures the two sets of nodes are evenly balanced.

Notebook 3 is the solution to Challenge 3:
Your task is to accomplish everything required in Challenge 1, but with an added constraint: the subgraphs formed by employees within each of the two sets must be connected.
